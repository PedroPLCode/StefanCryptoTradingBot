## Technologies Used
- Python :)
- Flask: A web framework used for building the application interface.
- Flask-SQLAlchemy: ORM used to manage the database.
- Flask-JWT-Extended: JWT-based authentication for securing user access.
- Flask-Mail: For sending email reports.
- Binance API: For fetching market data and executing trades.

## Future Plans
- Strategy Optimization: Enhancing strategies and trading logic.
- Machine Learning: Incorporating machine learning to improve trade predictions and make the bot more adaptive. That's how [MariolaCryptoTradingBot](https://github.com/PedroPLCode/MariolaCryptoTradingBot) was just born. All my effort is now directed toward her development.

## Important! Familiarize yourself thoroughly with the source code. Understand its operation. Only then will you be able to customize and adjust the bot to your own needs, preferences and requirements.
